**Goal:** Online marketplace to match freelance photographers with individuals/groups seeking photography sessions. 

**Main Audience:** Start off by targeting student/university environments, where there are many people interested in photography with varying levels of experience as well as people looking for photographers for graduation, student organizations, LinkedIn/online dating profiles, etc.
In the future, could be expanded to connect more advanced photographers with businesses (e.g. travel agencies, Airbnb listings, real estate, travel guides, etc.)

**Motivation:** Currently, photographers are often recruited through formal studios, personal portfolios, online gig platforms, Free & For Sale, etc. There is no centralized means for people to find photographers, it is difficult to make comparisons based on factors like price, experience, style, and schedules.
Our platform aims to (1) streamline this process for those seeking photographers, and (2) provide a platform, especially for newer photographers, to find clients and have a platform to grow and showcase their skills. Makes logistical planning and the details of a photoshoot much more transparent for both parties.
